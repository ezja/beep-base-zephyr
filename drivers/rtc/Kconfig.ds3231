      Sets log level for DS3231 RTC driver.
      Levels are:
      - 0 OFF, do not write
      - 1 ERROR, only write LOG_ERR
      - 2 WARNING, write LOG_WRN in addition to previous level
      - 3 INFO, write LOG_INF in addition to previous levels
      - 4 DEBUG, write LOG_DBG in addition to previous levels

config DS3231_RTC_ALARM_SUPPORT
    bool "Enable alarm support"

    help
      Enable support for alarms in the DS3231 RTC driver.
      This allows setting alarms and receiving interrupts
      when alarms trigger.

config DS3231_RTC_SQUARE_WAVE_SUPPORT
    bool "Enable square wave output support"
    default n
    help
      Enable support for square wave output on the INT/SQW pin.
      This allows configuring the DS3231 to output a square
      wave at various frequencies.

config DS3231_RTC_AGING_COMPENSATION
    bool "Enable aging compensation"
    default n
    help
      Enable support for aging compensation.
      This allows adjusting the oscillator frequency to
      compensate for crystal aging.

    help
      Enable temperature compensation support.
      The DS3231 includes an integrated temperature sensor
      that is used to maintain accuracy over temperature.

config DS3231_RTC_BATTERY_BACKUP
    bool "Enable battery backup"
    default y
    help
      Enable battery backup support.
      When enabled, the RTC will continue to run on battery
      power when main power is lost.
