      Device driver initialization priority.
      The driver must initialize after SPI but before
      the application starts.

      Sets log level for MX25 flash driver.
      Levels are:
      - 0 OFF, do not write
      - 1 ERROR, only write LOG_ERR
      - 2 WARNING, write LOG_WRN in addition to previous level

      Enable verification of written data by reading it back
      and comparing with the original data. This adds extra
      overhead but ensures data integrity.

      Enable QUAD SPI mode for faster read operations if
      supported by the flash chip. This requires proper
      pin configuration in the board's devicetree.

      Maximum size of write buffer in bytes. This affects
      the amount of RAM used by the driver. Larger buffers
      allow for more efficient write operations.
