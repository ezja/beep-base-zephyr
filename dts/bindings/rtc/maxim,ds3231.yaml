properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: I2C device address

  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the INT/SQW pin.
      This pin is active low and is used for alarm interrupts
      and/or square wave output.

  square-wave-enable:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: |
      Enable square wave output on INT/SQW pin.
      When enabled, the pin will output a square wave at
      the frequency specified by square-wave-freq.
      Cannot be used simultaneously with alarms.

  square-wave-freq:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1  # 1 Hz
      - 1024  # 1.024 kHz
      - 4096  # 4.096 kHz
      - 8192  # 8.192 kHz
    description: |
      Square wave output frequency in Hz.
      Only used when square-wave-enable is true.

  battery-backup:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: true
    description: |
      Enable battery backup mode.
      When enabled, the RTC will continue to run on battery
      power when main power is lost.

  aging-offset:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Aging offset value (-128 to +127).
      Can be used to compensate for crystal aging.
      Positive values add capacitance to the array,
      slowing the oscillator frequency.
