    description: |
      GPIO to use for the 1-Wire bus.
      The GPIO should be configured as open-drain.

  overdrive-speed:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: |
      Enable overdrive speed mode (if supported by slaves).
      When enabled, communication runs at 8x the standard speed.

    required: false
    description: |
      Optional GPIO to use for external pull-up control.
      Some implementations may want to control the pull-up
      separately for power saving.
