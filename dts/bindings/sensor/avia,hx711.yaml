      Default gain and channel setting
      1: Channel A with gain of 128
      2: Channel B with gain of 32
      3: Channel A with gain of 64

  samples:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 1
    description: |
      Number of samples to average for each reading.
      Higher values provide more stable readings but
      slower response time.

  offset:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Initial tare offset value.
      This value is subtracted from raw readings.

  scale:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 65536  # 1.0 in Q16.16 format
    description: |
      Initial scale factor in Q16.16 fixed-point format.
      Raw readings are multiplied by this value after
      offset subtraction. Default is 1.0 (65536 in Q16.16).
